class Version:
    """
    The software component version numbering is mostly inspired from
    Apache version numbering or similar other version numbering such as
    Semantic Versioning.  Version numbers are denoted using a standard
    tuple of integers: ``major.minor.patch``.

    A ``major`` version identifies the product stage of the project.  The
    basic intent is that ``major`` versions are incompatible, large-scale
    upgrades of the software component.  This enables a check of a client
    application against the latest version of the software component to
    ensure compatibility.  If there is a discrepancy between the two, the
    client application MUST be updated accordingly.

    A ``minor`` version is incremented when substantial new functionality
    or improvement are introduced; the ``major`` version number doesn't
    change.  A ``minor`` version retains backward compatibility with older
    minor versions.  It is NOT forward compatible as a previous ``minor``
    version doesn't include new functionality or improvement that has been
    introduced in this newer ``minor`` version.

    A ``patch`` version is incremented when bugs were fixed or
    implementation details were refactored.  The ``major`` and ``minor``
    version don't change.  A ``patch`` version is backward and forward
    compatible with older and newer patches of the same major and minor
    version.
